## How to Use the PSU Archive Explorer

Phantasy Star Universe stores most game data inside the **DATA** folder.  
Mods you create should be placed in the **Addon** folder and they will automatically load when the game launches.

1. Open the tool → **File → Open** → select a hashed file from the DATA folder.
2. The parser will automatically decrypt the file (if supported) and display its contents.

### Common File Extensions & Their Purpose

| Extension | Description |
|-----------|:------------|
| **ADX**   | Sound files (music, sound effects, voice acting) |
| **BIN**   | Text files and scripts (dialogue, menus, item descriptions, mission/enemy scripts). Often paired with **.k** files. |
| **DAT**   | General binary containers/archives (can contain almost anything) |
| **REL**   | Object and mission layout files (places enemies, props, triggers, etc.) |
| **K**     | Text/string files (alternative to .bin for localization and UI strings) |
| **NOM**   | Animation files (mainly player character animations) |
| **SFD**   | Video/cutscene files (often paired with ADX audio) |
| **PSO**   | Compiled Pixel Shader Object |
| **VSO**   | Compiled Vertex Shader Object |
| **XNA**   | Bone/skeleton name files |
| **XNCP**  | UI layout and control files (HUD, menus, interfaces) |
| **XNJ**   | 3D model files |
| **XNM**   | Model material and mesh data (usually paired with XNJ) |
| **XNR**   | Parameter/data table files (item stats, weapons, enemy drops, skills, technics, AI, etc.) |
| **XNT**   | Texture list / material mapping files (links texture slots in models to actual XVR textures) |
| **XVR**   | Texture files (characters, environments, UI, etc.) |

**Note**: To **replace** audio:
- Convert your `.wav` to ADX using **ADX Converter & Player** (available on GameBanana: https://gamebanana.com/tools/6491).
- Rename the resulting `.adx` to match the original hashed filename (remove the `.adx` extension).

Some audio may also be embedded inside `.dat` files and can sometimes be previewed by importing raw data into Audacity.
