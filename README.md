## How to Use the PSU Archive Explorer

Phantasy Star Universe stores most game data inside the **DATA** folder.  
Mods you create should be placed in the **Addon** folder and they will automatically load when the game launches.

1. Open the tool → **File → Open** → select a hashed file from the DATA folder.
2. The parser will automatically decrypt the file (if supported) and display its contents.

### Common File Extensions & Their Purpose

| Extension | Description |
|-----------|:------------|
| **ADX**   | Sound files (music, sound effects, voice acting) |
| **BIN**   | Text files and scripts (dialogue, menus, item descriptions, mission/enemy scripts). Often paired with **.k** files. |
| **DAT**   | General binary containers/archives (can contain almost anything) |
| **REL**   | Object and mission layout files (places enemies, props, triggers, etc.) |
| **K**     | Text/string files (alternative to .bin for localization and UI strings) |
| **NOM**   | Animation files (mainly player character animations) |
| **SFD**   | Video/cutscene files (often paired with ADX audio) |
| **PSO**   | Compiled Pixel Shader Object |
| **VSO**   | Compiled Vertex Shader Object |
| **XNA**   | Bone/skeleton name files |
| **XNCP**  | UI layout and control files (HUD, menus, interfaces) |
| **XNJ**   | 3D model files |
| **XNM**   | Model material and mesh data (usually paired with XNJ) |
| **XNR**   | Parameter/data table files (item stats, weapons, enemy drops, skills, technics, AI, etc.) |
| **XNT**   | Texture list / material mapping files (links texture slots in models to actual XVR textures) |
| **XVR**   | Texture files (characters, environments, UI, etc.) |

**Note**: To **replace** audio:
- Convert your `.wav` to ADX using **ADX Converter & Player** (available on GameBanana: https://gamebanana.com/tools/6491).
- Rename the resulting `.adx` to match the original hashed filename (remove the `.adx` extension).

If you want to edit audio files which are packed in .dat files, it is recommended to edit inside of Audacity in raw .dat format to preserve file headers. Otherwise, you would need to rewrite headers in a Hex Editor of your choice.
